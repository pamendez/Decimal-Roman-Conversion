## Description
This repostory represents the first homework of the theory component of the subject known as "Application Development Tendencies" (INS364), where an implementation of unit testing to an algorithm designed to convert decimal, or arabic, numerals into roman numerals takes place.

On one hand, roman numerals are any of the symbols used in a system of numerical notation based on the ancient Roman system. The symbols are I, V, X, L, C, D, and M (Gaur, A. et al, 2021, [source](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Roman-numeral)). 

On the other hand, arabic numerals, is a base-ten (decimal as it is commonly known) system since place values increase by powers of ten. The values are as follows: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 ("The Hindu—Arabic Number System and Roman Numerals", n.d., [source](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/waymakermath4libarts/chapter/the-hindu-arabic-number-system/)).

## Problem
Write down in a Markdown document the requirements, acceptance criteria and test cases before implementing the algorithm. Afterwards, use unit testing combined with the test-driven development paradigm to create an algorithm that converts arabic numerals to roman numerals.

## Software documentation
